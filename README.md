**Data Analysis and Visualization Projects**
**Overview**
This repository contains a collection of Data Analysis and Visualization Projects, showcasing a variety of datasets and techniques used for understanding data patterns, deriving insights, and presenting results visually. These projects include exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, clustering, and dashboard creation.

The repository aims to demonstrate how to approach real-world datasets and apply analytical techniques using Python, Power BI, and Tableau.
